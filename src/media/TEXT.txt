Can the Subaltern Speak?
Some of the most radical criticism coming out of the West today is the
result of an interested desire to conserve the subject of the West, or the West
as Subject. The theory of pluralized 'subject-effects' gives an illusion of
undermining subjective sovereignty while often providing a cover for this
subject of knowledge. Although the history of Europe as Subject is narrativized by the law, political economy, and ideology of the West, this

caught within the debate of the production of that Other, supporting or
critiquing the constitution of the Subject as Europe. It is also that, in the
constitution of that Other of Europe, great care was taken to obliterate
the textual ingredients with which such a subject could cathect, could
occupy (invest?) its itinerary - not only by ideological and scientific
production, but also by the institution of the law... In the face of the
possibility that the intellectual is complicit in the persistent constitution of
Other as the Self's shadow, a possibility of political practice for the intellectual would be to put the economic 'under erasure,' to see the economic
factor as irreducible as it reinscribes the social text, even as it is erased,
however imperfectly, when it claims to be the final determinant or the transcendental signified.
