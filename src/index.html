            <h2>Hall of Eyes</h2>
            <p>In her seminal article “Can The Subaltern Speak?” feminist theorist, Gayatri Spivak,
                asks whether it might be possible for the colonized – the subaltern – to have a voice
                in the face of colonial oppression. How might we reframe this same question in the
                context of contemporary digital culture? How could we find a way for the subaltern
                to speak that would also undermine the power of the oppressor?</p>
            <p>This project is inspired by the intriguing historical masks worn by
                the Bandari women from southern Iran. Legend has it that these masks were
                developed during Portuguese colonial rule, as a way of protecting the wearer
                from the gaze of slave masters looking for pretty women. Viewed from a contemporary
                perspective, they can be seen as a means of protecting women from
                patriarchal colonial oppression.</p>
            <p>In this project two masks begin to develop their own language to communicate with each
                other, blinking their eyelashes in rapid succession, using AI generated Morse code.
                The project draws upon a FaceBook experiment where – unnervingly – two AI bots began to
                develop their own language. It also draws upon an incident when an American soldier used
                his eyes to blink the word "TORTURE" using Morse Code during his captivity in Vietnam, and
                stories of women using code to report domestic abuse during the COVID19 lockdown. Here the
                ‘wink’ of the sexual predator is subverted into a language to protect women from the advances
                of a predator. This project involves AI, interactive design and critical thinking.</p>
